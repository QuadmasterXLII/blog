A blog?!  I know it's a bit 2005 of me, but take a chill pill and let me explain.

I have some serious free time ahead of me this summer.  I'm talking [build a helicopter in your back yard][helicopter] in your back yard level shit.  And since I don't have a pilot's license (or for that matter a back yard) I figured it might be good to try and learn some new skills and contribute to society somehow.  

At the end of May, I'm moving to Washington D.C. to start a new job.  The catch is that the job doesn't start until mid June, which gives me 6 weeks to kick back and watch the price is right _every day_.  Except I hate the price is right, so I need a plan.

The plan (recently hatched by my starry-eyed, overzealous self) is to spend time each day learning, tinkering, or otherwise bettering myself or the world in some kind of way.  I'd like to set a few goals _in writing_ so that I may be publically shamed when, 6 weeks from now, all I have to show for my summer is an intimate knowlege of ABC's LOST. Let's do it.

1. Set up a blog using [github pages][gh-pages] and [jekyll][jekyll-site] (**DONE**) 
2. Obtain the latest editions of CLRS and Cracking the Coding Interview.  If these seem like odd choices for someone who just landed a job, [give this a read][lifehacker-job].  
3. Continue contributing to [perfectapi/CKP][ckp].  I'm quite interested in cryptography and this project has been a great way to start learning what practical crypto looks like.  
4. Start looking into the [keepassxc][keepassxc] issue tracker.  Why doesn't it support KDBX4 yet?!
5. Excercise often.  Don't let all this techno crap get in the way of being healthy.
6. Get out and see the city, hike some, and enjoy the weekends.  There's nothing like staying cooped up in a 700 sq. ft. apartment to keep morale and productivity high.  
7. Read novels again.  Check out some of the titles from this year's [nebula awards][nebula].
8. Learn [golang][golang] properly.  I'm an avid subscriber of trial-by-fire, so I'll have to find another project suited for Go. 

That seems like enough to keep me at least semi-busy.  In addition, I like to keep up with the NY Times, Adam Savage's [Tested][tested], ISS goings on, and binge old movies (I've been itching to watch Apollo 13 all week so perhaps that will happen soon).  As I get into these and other little projects, I will write more meaty posts about what I learn.
